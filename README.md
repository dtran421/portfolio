## Development

### Getting Started

First, pull environment variables from Vercel using the following command:

```sh
npx vercel pull
```

It will install the Vercel package if needed and then save the env variables to the `.vercel` folder.

### Running the Server

To run the development server:

```bash
npx vercel dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

> Note that `npm run dev` will not work here as it will not load in the env variables!
