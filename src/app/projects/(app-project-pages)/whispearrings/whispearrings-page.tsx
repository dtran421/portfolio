    For my summer internship with Whispearrings, I was the sole mobile app developer tasked with spearheading the
    development of their iOS app. Since this was my first time doing mobile app development, I needed to research
    various new technologies, including XCode, Swift (Objective-C), and SQLite for the database. After two short but
    grueling months, I was able to produce an app that incorporated all of the techniques and coding concepts that I had
    been learning and performed the basic functions that my supervisors had asked for.
